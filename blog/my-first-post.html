💸 How to Make Money Online with GitHub

1. Join GitHub Sponsors

Sign up in your profile’s Sponsors section.

Offer tiers (e.g., $5–$20/month) with perks like early access or exclusive content.

Match content that adds value—tutorials, docs, or tooling—to encourage sponsorship.  


2. Create “Sponsorware” or Premium Releases

Offer early access or exclusive features to sponsors before open-sourcing them.

Caleb Porzio turned this into $100k/year income using a tiered release model + screencasts.  


3. Offer Consulting, Training & Support

Use your repositories as a portfolio and advertise services.

Provide premium add-ons (install help, customization, priority support).  


4. Take Part in Bounties & Paid OSS

Contribute to open-source projects that pay for issues or features.

Browse curated lists like [kunovsky/paid-open-source-projects] for opportunities that pay $50–$2,000+  


5. Work on Bug Bounties & Security

Join programs like GitHub’s HackerOne bounties for finding security issues.

Bug hunters can earn thousands per report.  


6. Build Passive-Income Tools

Create CLI tools or Docker setups that monetize bandwidth sharing, task automation, or APIs.

Example repos: “money4band,” “earning-machine,” “passive-income stacks.”
